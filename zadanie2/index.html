                        Whether you prefer to go into battle alone or with a team, Tenno, Loki will adapt to any
                        style.</b>

                        Loki is a fragile but fast manipulator Warframe. He has little in the way of direct
                        damage abilities, instead focusing on the arts of distraction, deception, sabotage,
                        relocation and stealth.

                        Ember's presence on the battlefield is devastating. Mind the heat, Tenno.</b>

                        Empress of elemental flame, scorch the land with her wildfires.
                        Control her fury or fuel the heat to unleash destructive incineration,
                        leaving charred corpses and ashes adrift in her scarlet sea.
                        Ember's flame first sparked in Vanilla and reignited in Update 26.0: The Old Blood.

                    <p><br>
                        Rhino is a heavily armored Warframe with the strength and fortitude of his reckless,
                        stampeding namesake.
                        Rhino trades speed for power and is designed to fill the tank role in a cell,
                        with the capability to charge into the fray, draw enemy fire, and bend the battlefield to
                        his will through sheer brute force.

                        blade,
                        he is a mobile swordsman with potent methods of execution. Excalibur is one of three starter
                        options for new players.

                        provide cover and complement the ranged and melee combat of his cell.
                        The electrical nature of his abilities make him highly effective against the Corpus,
                        with their robots in particular. He is one of three starter options for new players.
